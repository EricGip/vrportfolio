# An interactive VR portfolio made with Aframe (HTML &amp; JS)
-------
Created with HTML, Javascript, and Oculus Quest.  
   * To view the source code, check out index.html and Vivian.html 
   * assets are just the images and models, this would be more reliable and load faster than calling a CDN for the images.
   * /js/ contains the javascript components that handle eventhandling, touch, portal links, etc. 

Coming from data science, I only knew Python. I started growing an interest in web development from Python's backend library, Django, and found that I would need to learn Javascript, HTML, and CSS to really become a full-stack web developer.

This was really intimidating to me as I was more interested in backend & infrastructure but I would have to learn 3 languages just to learn front end?   
    
I just found out about WebVR and was immediately inspired and eager to design my own project.  
    
As a new web developer, this project solidified my understanding of the DOM model, working with components, object oriented programming, and the front end languages.

My goal was to create a gallery for to showcase my girlfriend's small business - designing GameCube controllers in hopes to gain more customers with a *memorable, interactive gallery*.  

I now have a solid understanding of VR elements, front end elements, 3d modeling, and game design.   
My next plans are to use Unity or Unreal Engine to design a full-fledged VR app after I start my software engineering career.

To Dos:

   * Add functionality to pokeballs, be able to catch the models!
