# An interactive VR portfolio made with Aframe (HTML &amp; JS)
-------
Created with HTML, Javascript, and Oculus Quest.

Coming from data science, I only knew python. I started growing an interest in web development from python's backend library, Django, and found that I would need to learn Javascript, HTML, and CSS to really become a full-stack web developer. 

This was really intimidating to me and learning React from scratch was difficult, so through more research I was able to find out that the A-frame library was perfect for people in my position!

My goal was to create a gallery for to showcase my girlfriend's small business - designing GameCube controllers in hopes to gain more customers with a *memorable, interactive gallery*.
